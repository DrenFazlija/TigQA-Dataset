TigQA: RC Question Answering Dataset in Tigrinya Language
  **Abstract** 
It is hard-pressed to find TigQA datasets that perfectly suit educational domain needs.This paper addresses the challenge of limited annotated datasets for low-resource languages. We investigate the feasibility of utilising machine translation (MT) to create a Tigrinya dataset following the style of Stanford's Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). We evaluate three publicly available MT systems, ultimately selecting Google MT based on error analysis. Various translation quality assessment methods are employed, including auto translation and human comparisons. Furthermore, we examine the impact of translation quality on downstream tasks using the BERT model. Our findings underscore the challenges posed by translation errors and emphasise the necessity of human intervention to enhance translation quality. As a result, We proudly introduce TigQA, a Tigriya reading comprehension dataset sourced from student textbooks. TigQA comprises 2285 question-answer pairs across 455 pages and 457 context paragraphs, spanning 118 diverse topics. We evaluate it using our baseline model XML-R, reporting an F1 score of 66.76 and an EM of 47.07 This study significantly contributes to the endeavour of creating resources for low-resource African languages, specifically in the development of a Tigrigna dataset. It accomplishes this by highlighting the substantial challenges associated with utilising machine translation (MT) for low-resource language dataset creation. This, in turn, promotes further research and advancement in Tigrinya natural language processing and the design of customised question answering systems tailored to low-resource languages.  

###The dataset can be used for the tasks. 
1. The TigQA dataset is therefore a good starting point for different natural language tasks that require question answer sets. Some of the key applications include for:
Development of conversational AI systems: The TigQA dataset can be utilized to train conversational AI systems specifically tailored for the education sector. These systems will be designed to understand and accurately respond to student questions posed in Tigrigna. By leveraging the question-answer pairs in the dataset, the AI systems can provide relevant and informative answers, thereby enhancing the learning experience for Tigrigna-speaking students.

2. Machine Learning models for topic identification: The TigQA dataset can serve as a valuable resource for training Machine Learning models to identify and understand complex topics discussed in Tigrinya Text corpora. By applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques, these models can automatically recognize and categorize different subject matters. This can facilitate more efficient searching for students, enabling them to ask questions in their native Tigrinya language and receive targeted and accurate information.

3. Automatic summarization algorithms: The question-answer pairs in the TigQA dataset can be utilized to develop automatic summarization algorithms. These algorithms can extract key information and generate concise summaries from the dataset. By condensing the content and presenting the most relevant information, students can quickly grasp the main points and gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics covered in the TigQA dataset.

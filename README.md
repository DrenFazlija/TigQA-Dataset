# TigQA: Tigrigna Question Answering Dataset

It is hard-pressed to find TigQA datasets that perfectly suit educational domain needs. Existing datasets for reading comprehension typically focus on English.To get machines to make progress on reading comprehension tasks, many large QA datasets have been released in different languages like SQuAD, Narrative QA, RACE, Trivia QA, MS-MARCO QA, WikiQA and also AMQA. SQuAQ and AMQA use Wikipedia as a source of articles. Wikipedia serves as an open-source knowledge repository for many languages and communities. However, there is a disparity in the quality and quantity of content based on the languages. Low-resource languages like Tigrinya suffer from poor quality as well as a minimum number of articles in Wikipedia. Additionally, the content available in these languages are sometimes not contextually relevant. This motivates us to prepare the first expert labeled Question Answering dataset for Educational Domain. 
The dataset can be used for different tasks. 
1. The TigQA dataset is therefore a good starting point for different natural language tasks that require question answer sets. Some of the key applications include for:
Development of conversational AI systems: The TigQA dataset can be utilized to train conversational AI systems specifically tailored for the education sector. These systems will be designed to understand and accurately respond to student questions posed in Tigrigna. By leveraging the question-answer pairs in the dataset, the AI systems can provide relevant and informative answers, thereby enhancing the learning experience for Tigrigna-speaking students.

2. Machine Learning models for topic identification: The TigQA dataset can serve as a valuable resource for training Machine Learning models to identify and understand complex topics discussed in Tigrinya Text corpora. By applying natural language processing and machine learning techniques, these models can automatically recognize and categorize different subject matters. This can facilitate more efficient searching for students, enabling them to ask questions in their native Tigrinya language and receive targeted and accurate information.

3. Automatic summarization algorithms: The question-answer pairs in the TigQA dataset can be utilized to develop automatic summarization algorithms. These algorithms can extract key information and generate concise summaries from the dataset. By condensing the content and presenting the most relevant information, students can quickly grasp the main points and gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics covered in the TigQA dataset.
#Dataset
Tigrinya is a language that is spoken by more than 10 million native speakers in Tigray, Ethiopia, and Eritrea [Abdelkadir et al., 2023]. Annotated corpora are usually rare Tigrigna, hindering advancement in QA research.Question in Tigrinya can be made by starting with interrogative pronouns such as   “እንታይ “(what),”መዓስ “(when), “ኣበይ “(where), “መን“(who)”ከምኡ እውን”(as well as) “ ንሱ ድዩ / ንሱ ?“(Did he/she), “ድዩ ቀሪቡ(“Is/Was he”) for a given paragraph. In addition, we included temporal events-based questions such as “መዓስ እዩ ስምምዕ ተገይሩ“ (When did agreement perform . . .), “መንግስቲ ቅድሚ / ድሕሪ እተወሰነ እዋን እንታይ ገበረ ?” (What did the government do before/after a certain time”), "ሃይላይ ኣብ ሓደ እዋን ከመይ ዝበለ ስምዒታዊ ኵነታት እዩ ነይሩ", (What emotional state Hailay was at a particular time), etc.
As shown bellow, the TigQA dataset contains context, question, and answer triplets. The contexts are paragraphes  collected from student text books . The question-answer pairs are created by subject experts and annotated using the Haystack QA annotation tool(https://annotate.deepset.ai/). 2700 Question answer pairs are created from the total of 500 pages, 128 topics ,482 paragraphs all are from student textbook. The whole TigQA dataset can be avilable here. We also split the datset into train, dev, and test with a size of 2000, 500, and 200 respectively.
